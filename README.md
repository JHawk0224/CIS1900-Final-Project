# CIS1900-Final-Project
Jordan Hochman's Final Projcet for CIS 1900 (C++)

Project Proposal:
I would like to make Snake in C++, and to make it more complex, I will add extra features. This includes being able to save/load the game state from a file, and having powerups (special apples) that do certain things (like make snake invincible for a short time, place multiple apples, speed it up, and etc.)

I am going to be in a group by myself for this final project, so I will be doing all of the work and thus there is no need to split up the work.

For this project, I plan to use smart pointers to make the 2D array for the game board, but I also might use vectors or other lists instead. I also plan to have a class heirarchy for the apples, as the powerups will just be different types of apples. There will be a base apple, and then other apples that have special properties and create special effects. They will also have different looks on the game board. The game will be text-based and be operated in a similar manner to the midterm project, minesweeper.

Write a short proposal (<500 words) describing your project. In particular, describe any libraries or frameworks you plan to use. Talk about what features of C++ you expect to use, and how you plan to structure your project (Does it have a class hierarchy? Is it a series of class templates?). Provide an estimate for the time you expect to spend on different parts of the project, and how you expect the work will be split within your group.
