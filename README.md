# CIS1900-Final-Project
Jordan Hochman's Final Projcet for CIS 1900 (C++)

Project Proposal:
I would like to make Snake in C++, and to make it more complex, I will add extra features. This includes being able to save/load the game state from a file, and having powerups (special apples) that do certain things (like make snake invincible for a short time, place multiple apples, speed it up, and etc.)

For this project, I plan to use smart pointers to make the 2D array for the game board, but I also might use vectors or other lists instead. I also plan to have a class heirarchy for the apples, as the powerups will just be different types of apples. There will be a base apple, and then other apples that have special properties and create special effects. They will also have different looks on the game board. The game will be text-based and be operated in a similar manner to the midterm project, minesweeper (I also might use ANSI text to color the terminal output).

I am going to be in a group by myself for this final project, so I will be doing all of the work and thus there is no need to split up the work. I will split up my time accordingly to whichever parts take the longest, and I am not expecting to have to focus more time on a specific part.

I am also open to implementing other features or suggestions you have to improve my project or use more concepts we learned in class.
