# CIS1900-Final-Project
Final Projcet for CIS 1900 (C++)

Project Proposal:
I would like to make Snake in C++, and to make it more complex, I will add extra features. This includes being able to save/load the game state from a file, and having powerups (special apples) that do certain things (like make snake invincible for a short time, place multiple apples, speed it up, and etc.)

I am going to be in a group by myself for this final project, so I will be doing all of the work and thus there is no need to split up the work.

Write a short proposal (<500 words) describing your project. In particular, describe any libraries or frameworks you plan to use. Talk about what features of C++ you expect to use, and how you plan to structure your project (Does it have a class hierarchy? Is it a series of class templates?). Provide an estimate for the time you expect to spend on different parts of the project, and how you expect the work will be split within your group.

Make a Github repo for your project (it can be either public or private), and add the course staff. Our Github usernames are Grain and yiyunliu. Include the proposal in the Github repo, so we can make comments in a pull request.
